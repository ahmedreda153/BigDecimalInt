we emailed you a little while ago to ask for your help resolving an issue with your paypal account.
your account is still temporarily limited because we haven't heard from you.

we noticed some unusual log in activity with your account. please check that no one has logged in to
your account without your permission.

to help us with this and to see what you can and can't do with your account until the issue is resolved,
log in to your account and go to the resolution center.

as always, if you need help or have any questions, feel free to contact us. we're always here to help.

thank you for being a paypal customer.
